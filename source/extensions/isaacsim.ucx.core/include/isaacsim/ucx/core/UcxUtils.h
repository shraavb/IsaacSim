/**
 * @brief Wait for a UCX request to complete with timeout.
 * @details
 * Polls the request status until it completes, fails, or the timeout expires.
 * If timeoutMs is g_kUcxInfiniteTimeout (UINT32_MAX), waits indefinitely until completion or failure.
 *
 * The function uses a configurable polling interval which provides a balance
 * between responsiveness and CPU usage. The default interval (1ms) is suitable
 * for most real-time simulation scenarios.
 *
 * @param[in] request UCX request to wait for (must not be null)
 * @param[in] timeoutMs Timeout in milliseconds (g_kUcxInfiniteTimeout = infinite wait)
 * @param[out] errorMessage String for storing error messages from checkError()
 * @param[in] pollIntervalUs Polling interval in microseconds (default: 1000)
 * @return UcxRequestWaitResult indicating the outcome:
 *         - eCompleted: Request finished successfully (UCS_OK)
 *         - eTimedOut: Timeout expired before completion (request is cancelled)
 *         - eFailed: Null request or UCX error status (not UCS_OK or UCS_INPROGRESS)
 *
 * @note This function is thread-safe if the UCX request object is thread-safe.
 * @warning Polling with very short intervals may consume significant CPU when
 *          multiple nodes are polling simultaneously. Consider using intervals
 *          >= 1000μs (1ms) for non-critical operations.
